# petnetsim
Petri Network simulator
* priorities
* inhibitors
* timed 
* stochastic time
* alternative transitions with defined uneven probabilities
* direct simulation API
* JSON file format
* editor
* animated simulation in the editor (good for demonstration and teaching)

# Known bugs
* simulation: timed and untimed transitions do not work well together
* editor: counters for new names reset causing name collisions when adding new things to existing models

# TODO
* more p-distributions for time
* fix bug: timed and untimed transitions do not work well together
* fix bug: name collisions for extending existing models
